PyConCZ 2016
============

PyCon CZ is coming back to Brno for it's second edition on 28-30th October 2016.

Contributing
------------

PyCon CZ website is using Python 3.5/Django for the backend, NodeJS/webpack for
bundling frontend assets and Postgresql as a database (SQLite in dev).

### Setup dev environment

#### Manually

Inside `pyconcz_2016` directory,
run following commands to setup project for local development:

1. Prepare postgresql database: user `pyconcz`, database `pyconcz`
1. `mkvirtualenv -p python3.5 pyconcz`
2. `pip install -r dev-requirements.txt`
3. `./manage.py migrate`
4. `./manage.py runserver`
5. Open [http://localhost:8000]()

If and **only if** you also want to work with styles and javascript, you need to have `node.js`.
Inside root directory (the same directory where `manage.py` is) run following commands:

1. Add following line to your `/etc/hosts` file: `127.0.0.1 lan.pycon.cz`.
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

Now open [http://lan.pycon.cz:8000]() and you should have development version of
website with webpack hot reloading enabled.

### Building

**You only need this when you changed styles**. Webpack creates static files with unique filenames (appending file hash). After
each production build, you have to commit new files. Don't care about the old
ones at the moment.

1. `npm run build` (or `docker-compose run webpack npm run build` when using docker)
2. `git add pyconcz_2016/static_build`
